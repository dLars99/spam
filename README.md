Answers to the final Practice Exercise in NSS Book 3, Chapter 5: Array Methods.  The challenge is to take the customer array and extract a second array containing only the customers' email addresses.

The original request asked for nested methods to complete the task. I found a way to do this utilizing map and flat methods. At the same point in my research that I found this solution, however, I also found the flatMap() method, which accomplishes the goal in a single command.
